config

Here be config files. They can be yaml or lua. all configs here are loaded
automatically, except for anything in subdirectories (such as config/delayed)

lua configs (such as config/foo.lua) are not expected to be complex, 
and are loaded right after .

Default yaml config file list:
	app.yaml			general webylene config. place general env config here.
	templates.yaml		template config
	urls.yaml			url to script mappings. You'll want to play with this one.
