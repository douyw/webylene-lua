these are output templates. those with a .lp extension are luaPages templates.
for more information, see http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/manual.html#templates
Templates are autodiscovered by webylene, but they can (and frequently will) be 
configured manually in config/templates.yaml.

Note: you need not include cgilua or any such thing, luapages is bundled with webylene.

in an MVC context, these here files are the Views.
